🔍 Features

✅ AI-Based Crop Grading — Farmers upload videos; YOLOv8 classifies crop quality (A/B/C).
✅ Asynchronous Processing — Backend and model communicate via webhooks to prevent timeouts.
✅ Kannada Voice Bot — Farmers can talk in Kannada and get replies in Kannada text and voice.
✅ Direct Bidding System — Buyers can bid live on graded produce.
✅ Cloud-Native Design — Each service deployed independently (scalable, modular).
✅ Multilingual UI — Built with react-i18next for seamless language toggling.
