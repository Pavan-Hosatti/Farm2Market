# Tailwind CSS Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Tailwind CSS correctly in your project. Currently, it appears that Tailwind CSS is not working properly, but we can fix this with a few steps.

## 1. Required Dependencies

First, make sure you have the correct versions installed:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```

## 2. Configuration Files

Create or update the following configuration files:

### tailwind.config.js

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // Keep your existing theme extension here
    }
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

### postcss.config.js

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

## 3. CSS Setup

Update your `src/index.css` file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Import your custom styles after Tailwind */
@import './styles/global.css';
```

## 4. For Vite Projects

If you're using Vite (which you appear to be), make sure your `vite.config.js` has the necessary plugins:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  // Your other Vite config
})
```

## 5. Troubleshooting

If Tailwind still isn't working after these changes, try:

1. Deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling with `npm install`
2. Running `npx tailwindcss init -p` to generate fresh config files
3. Checking for errors in the console during compilation
4. Verifying that all import paths are correct
5. Restarting your development server

## 6. Temporary Solution

In the meantime, you can use the CSS classes we've provided in `test.css` and inline styles to achieve the modern look you want until the Tailwind configuration is resolved.
